- [ ] Pull out the Notes (I use xmind and excel)
- [ ] **Questions to keep in mind**
  - [ ] how does this app pass data?
  - [ ] Does it use a resource, parameter, value, format?
    - [ ] *https://app.com/resource?parameter=value&param2=value*
  - [ ] Or does it use a RESTful format?
    - [ ] https://app.com/route/resource/sub-resource/...
  - [ ] How/where does the app talk about users?
    - [ ] This helps with finding Access, Authorization, Logic, and Information Disclosure bugs.
  - [ ] Does the site have multi-tenancy or different user levels?
    - [ ] This will also dictate how we test for authorization and access bugs.
  - [ ] Has there been past security research & vulns?
  - [ ] how does the web application framework protect against a common type of vulnerability and have there been any bypasses?
    - [ ] XSS, CSRF, Input validation, Output Encoding, etc.
    - [ ] how does it store data? 
    - [ ] Where are image and file uploads going?
    - [ ] What kind of database do I think they are using?
- [ ] **Walk the Site**
  - [ ] Just casually browser and see how the site works.
- [ ] **Subdomain Enumeration**
  - [ ] Find double subdomains
  - [ ] Use excel for large subdomains and mindmaps for other things
  - [ ] Subfinder
  - [ ] Amass
  - [ ] Shodan (karma_v2 tool)
  - [ ] Cloud Recon (https://github.com/g0ldencybersec/CloudRecon)
  - [ ] Burp Pro
  - [ ] Google Dorking and Github Dorking
  - [ ] Brute Forcing Subdomains
  - [ ] Permutation (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/alterx)
- [ ] **Identify Apex Domains and IP Ranges**
  - [ ] Apex domains are domains that are owned by the company, so example.co.sp and example.co.uk
  - [ ] We find this by looking at a targets ASN.
    - [ ] https://github.com/expl0itabl3/check_mdi/blob/main/check_mdi.py
    - [ ] https://bgp.he.net
    - [ ] https://dnschecker.com
    - [ ] Reverse whois (https://whoxy.com)
- [ ] **Find email structure**
  - [ ] Use Hunter.io
- [ ] **Find emails**
  - [ ] Check LinkedIn
  - [ ] Visit dehashed and see if passwords exist to try
  - [ ] Also visit spycloud.com
- [ ] **Spider Target**
  - [ ] BurpSuite, Caido, or Zap
  - [ ] Run hakrawler to spider and send through proxy
    - [ ] Use `cat <file_url> | hakrawler -proxy "http://<proxy>:<port>"`
- [ ] **Directory Brute Force (use VPN)**
  - [ ] Waymore for passive approach
    - [ ] Find True IP (if behind WAF IP)
    - [ ] Find JS Files (spidering)
- [ ] **If the scope is large**
  - [ ] Enumerate COTS apps by their favicon with favfreak
- [ ] **Find APIs**
    - [ ] RESTful
    - [ ] GraphQL
    - [ ] SOAP
- [ ] **Find JS files**
  - [ ] We want to eventually search those for Endpoints, parameters, routes, secrets, domains.
- [ ] **Filter for parameters in burp/zap and scan for param vulns.**
- [ ] Data Exposure Dorking with google and github
- [ ] **Find Technologies used:**
  - [ ] Wappalyzer and/or Builtwith
- [ ] **Save Live Subdomains (httpx to verify status of subdomains)**
- [ ] **Port Scan**
  - [ ] nmap, naabu, masscan, etc
- [ ] **Endpoint Detection**
- [ ] **Content Discovery**
  - [ ] Jot down all of the kinds of content you discovered
  - [ ] This includes: profile section, integration functions, paid functions, api calls (authenticated and unauthenticated), upload/export functions, undocumented api calls and admin tools, Multiple User Levels, Customer Data, Persistent User Input, Reflective Values, Hidden Forms, etc.
  - [ ] Start thinking about and researching how each discovery can be exploited. Right down possible exploitation paths, and what has been done in the past.
  - [ ] Check is the app is open source or COTS. 
    - [ ] If there is a Demo, source code, leaked code, etc. Then download the code and run it. Figure out how it is working.
    - [ ] Use source2URL to port the application through burp to figure out how it is working
    - [ ] For COTS, there is a good chance that there are DEMOS, reach out and see if you can get admin access to a demo.
      - [ ] If you do, grab all of the paths, routes, and parameters when proxying. These will be added to the potential attack vector.
    - [ ] Sometimes, COTS source code is posted on https://hub.docker.com/ . Search there to see if its leaked.
  - [ ] Search sources that archive historical data.
    - [ ] https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore
- [ ] **Identify and document Data entry points and search params**
    - [ ] login forms
    - [ ] signup forms
    - [ ] search parameters
    - [ ] interesting parameters
    - [ ] Contact us
    - [ ] other forms
    - [ ] forgot password
    - [ ] file upload
    - [ ] file download
    - [ ] hidden fields
    - [ ] comment sections
    - [ ] etc
- [ ] **Jot down 401**
  - [ ] sometimes we can Brute force recursive directories to get passed 401
    - [ ] for exampled, if example.com/search is 401, then maybe futher down would work, like example.com/search/users
- [ ] **APK info disclosure (APKLeaks)**
- [ ] **Identify Hidden Content**
    - [ ] https://github.com/Papurudoragon/XnlReveal
- [ ] **Ask questions**
  - [ ] How Does the app pass data?
  - [ ] How/where does the app talk to users?
  - [ ] Does the app have mult-tenancy or user levels?
  - [ ] Has there been past security research & vulns?
  - [ ] Does the app have a unique threat model?
  - [ ] How does the app/framework handle specific vuln classes?
  - [ ] How does the web app framework protect against a common type of vuln, and have there been any bypasses?
  - [ ] How does it store data?
- [ ] **Test for Debug Parameters**
    - [ ] Parameters names like debug, test, log, console, etc.
- [ ] **Check robots.txt and sitemaps**
- [ ] **Vulnerability scanning**
  - [ ] Nuclei or BurpSuite Pro can help
  - [ ] Custom templates can be found at: https://github.com/Papurudoragon/cent_nuclei_templates
  - [ ] AllForOne is a great nuclei template that covers ALL TEMPLATES! https://github.com/AggressiveUser/AllForOne
  - [ ] ***You can also research new vulns and create templates in nuclei, that has not already been done***
- [ ] **Check for CVEs**
    - [ ] Nuclei Scan
    - [ ] ExploitDB
    - [ ] Snyk
- [ ] **What to look out for:**
  - [ ] Logins
  - [ ] Default Content
  - [ ] Bypass Domains (dev, qa, ww1, ww2)
  - [ ] 302's
  - [ ] Basic Auth
  - [ ] Old looking frameworks
  - [ ] Outdated Priv Pol / Trademark
- [ ] **Check for past vulnerabilities and bugs**
  - [ ] Bounty Platform reports, github, google dorking, etc.
  - [ ] See if the fix has a bypass
- [ ] **Start searching for Vulnerabilities from the obtained results from above**
  - [ ] Research which vulns may be applicable
- [ ] **Ask Key questions to understand the attack surface**
  - [ ] Are there vulnerabilities associated with Proxy, WAF, and/or Technology Used?
- [ ] **Chatbots!**
    - [ ] Chatbots should be tested for blind xss
    - [ ] More importantly, companies are slowing swtiching to AI... keep an eye our for prompt injection :)
- [ ] **Change Detection for the future**
