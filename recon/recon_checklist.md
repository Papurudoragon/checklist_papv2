- [ ] **Identify and document Data entry points and search params**
    - [ ] login forms
    - [ ] signup forms
    - [ ] search parameters
    - [ ] interesting parameters
    - [ ] Contact us
    - [ ] other forms
    - [ ] forgot password
    - [ ] file upload
    - [ ] file download
    - [ ] hidden fields
    - [ ] comment sections
    - [ ] etc
- [ ] **Brute force recursive directories to get passed 401**
    - [ ] if example.com/search is 403, then maybe futher down would work, like example.com/search/users
- [ ] **APK info disclosure (APKLeaks)**
- [ ] **Identify Hidden Content**
    - [ ] https://github.com/Papurudoragon/XnlReveal
- [ ] **Ask questions**
  - [ ] Does the app pass data?
  - [ ] How/where does the app talk to users?
  - [ ] Does the app have mult-tenancy or user levels?
  - [ ] Has there been past security research & vulns?
  - [ ] Does the app have a unique threat model?
  - [ ] How does the app/framework handle specific vuln classes?
  - [ ] How does the web app framework protect against a common type of vuln, and have there been any bypasses?
  - [ ] How does it store data?
- [ ] **Test for Debug Parameters**
    - [ ] Parameters names like debug, test, log, console, etc.
- [ ] **Check robots.txt and sitemaps**
- [ ] **Vuln scan with Nuclei or BurpSuite**
    - [ ] Custom templates can be found at: https://github.com/Papurudoragon/cent_nuclei_templates

  - [ ] Outdated Priv Pol / Trademark
- [ ] **Check for past vulnerabilities and bugs**
  - [ ] Bounty Platform reports, github, google dorking, etc.
  - [ ] See if the fix has a bypass
- [ ] **Start searching for Vulnerabilities from the obtained results from above**
  - [ ] Research which vulns may be applicable
- [ ] **Ask Key questions to understand the attack surface**
  - [ ] Are there vulnerabilities associated with Proxy, WAF, and/or Technology Used?
- [ ] **Change Detection for the future**
