  - [ ] Hidden Funcionalty chain
- [ ] **Account Section**
  - [ ] Profile
    - [ ] Stored XSS, Blind XSS (just put a blind payload in)
  - [ ] App Custom Fields
    - [ ] Stored XSS, SSTI
  - [ ] Integrations
    - [ ] SSRF, XSS
- [ ] **Email**
  - [ ] Email injection
  - [ ] Email-based SSRF
  - [ ] Parameter Pollution
  - [ ] Email Header Injection
  - [ ] Wildcard abuse
  - [ ] Email-based XSS
- [ ] **HTTP Requests**
  - [ ] When to try HTTP Request Smuggling (Double Requests)
    - [ ] Presence of multiple Front-Ends like CDN or load balancers
    - [ ] Application behaves inconsistently with Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding
    - [ ] Application gives different responses to the same request
    - [ ] Outdated software with a history of this vulnerability
    - [ ] Error messages in response to ambiguous 
- [ ] **Errors**
  - [ ] Exotic Injection
  - [ ] App DoS
  - [ ] Injection
- [ ] **Paths or URLS passed as values**
  - [ ] SSRF
  - [ ] Redirects
- [ ] **Parameters**
  - [ ] Do you see something like '\__proto__\'?
    - [ ] Prototype pollution
  - [ ] Dynamic Scanning/Web Fuzzing/Payload Scanning (injecting various payloads into 1 param to see how it behaves)
    - [ ] Burp Pro can help, but other tools like ffuf also exist
      - [ ] if you use burp pro: when you feel like a parameter might be subject to a vulnerability and you want to specifically scan it you can send the request to intruder, mark the place with payload markers, and then right click and choose scan defined insertion points.
  - [ ] Fault Injection
    - [ ] Fuzz routes and parameters to elicit errors with: https://portswigger.net/research/backslash-powered-scanning-hunting-unknown-vulnerability-classes
      - [ ] Interpreting Results with SSQLR
      - [ ] Sensitive = Status Code
      - [ ] Secrets = Size
      - [ ] Were = Word Count
      - [ ] Leaked = Lines
      - [ ] Recently = Response Time
  - [ ] IDOR
- [ ] **Status Codes**
- [ ] 401 - 




- [ ] **Chatbots**
  - [ ] Blind XSS
  - [ ] Prompt Injection (AI)
- [ ] **CVE**
    - [ ] Google dork / Github Dork for vulnerabilities with tech used and versions
    - [ ] Exploitdb for vulns
    - [ ] Metasploit for vulns
    - [ ] Snyk is also good for learning about what vulns are out there for a tech
    - [ ] Sometimes chatgpt can even give you CVE numbers to search up.
    
<h1>Vulnerabilites, but how do you know?</h1>

- [ ] **Reflected XSS**
  - [ ] Valid URL (Browser Renders it)
  - [ ] Explicit decoding on server-side to break context and execute javscript
  - [ ] No server-side decoding is useful to break the context and execute javascript
  - [ ] SVG based Javascript Execution
    - [ ] Can also be used to inject a payload in img tags (example <\img src="https://example.com/xss%22nmouseover=%22alert(1);imagefile.svg" onmouseover="alert(1)" alt>)
    - [ ] also look for "data:image/svg+xml;base64,..."
    - [ ] also look for <\img src="">
      - [ ] Example: <\img src=javscript:while(1){}> //DoS script
- [ ] **Stored XSS**
  - [ ] You need a valid URL, and a Sink to have the criteria for stored XSS
    - [ ] Common sinks: [
      eval()
      Function()
      setTimeout()
      setInterval()
      setImmediate()
      execCommand()
      execScript()
      msSetImmediate()
      range.createContextualFragment()
      crypto.generateCRMFRequest()
      ]
    - [ ] To exploit, you have to place data into a source (input, parameter, etc) this is propogated to a sink
    - [ ] To test for this, you can use dev tools and test each source, looking for sinks.
      - [ ] Burp scanner can automate this.

- [ ] **SOAP Injection**
  - [ ] submit a rogue closing tag like <\/foo>
    - [ ] If no error is received, then not vulnerable
    - [ ] If an error is received, then enter a valid open and closing pair <\foo></\foo>
      - [ ] If this causes the error to disappear, then the application is vulnerable.
    - [ ] You can also use comments to open and close parameters !----> or </!---- 

- [ ] **Server-side HTTP redirect**
  - [ ] Check parameters that contain hostnames like "location" to see if they will redirect the server to an external site.
  - [ ] If there is a long delay, then the server might be timing out due to rules or restrictions
